# mbBayesABLD: Multi-Breed Genomic Prediction Bayesian Model

User Manual for Multi-Breed Joint Prediction Models that Accounting for Heterogeneous Genetic (Co)variance Software V1.0

## 1. Software Introduction

**mbBayesABLD** is a multi-breed joint genomic prediction tool designed for livestock and poultry populations, but it is also applicable to plant populations. **mbBayesABLD** allows for more accurate sharing of information between breeds, thereby improving the accuracy of breeding value estimation for small-scale breeds within joint reference populations. In this model, chromosomes are first partitioned into blocks based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) information, and a genetic correlation estimate between populations is obtained for each independent block. Information is precisely shared between breeds through the correlations between the genetic marker effects.

This tool enables the calculation of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) for all individuals based on their phenotypic and genotypic data. It provides the ability to effectively leverage information from multiple breeds, significantly enhancing breeding selection efficiency and the overall productivity of the industry.

## 2. Installation Instructions

The program was developed on the `CentOS Linux release 7.9.2003` platform and is based on Linux version `3.10.0-1127.19.1.el7.x86_64` kernel version. It should be able to run on any Unix-like system.

Considering that the program is mainly developed in C language, it should also be runnable on Windows or macOS systems after recompilation.

This software is designed for genomic prediction and requires input in the form of phenotypic records and genotypic information of the analyzed individuals (typically in the form of SNP arrays). Additionally, due to matrix storage and computational processes, extra storage demands may arise during analysis. We recommend that the computer running the software has at least 10GB of available memory. For larger populations, more system memory will be required depending on the population size.

This software relies on the `IntelÂ® oneAPI Math Kernel Library` for scientific calculations (no version requirement). Users need to ensure the existence of this dependencies in their runtime environment. 

## 3. Quick Start

Please note that, unless otherwise specified, all of the following operations are carried out in Linux command-line mode.

### 3.1 Installation

The software provides pre-compiled binary files that can be directly downloaded and used:

```bash
wget https://github.com/CAU-TeamLiuJF/mbBayesABLD/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cd mbBayesABLD-main
chmod 755 ./bin/mbBayesABLD
```

### 3.2 Running the Software

To run the software, simply enter the relevant commands in the command line:

```bash
cd example
../bin/mbBayesABLD --bfile /path/to/plink/binary/genotype/file/prefix --phef /path/to/phenotype/file [options] ...
```
**bfile** is the genotype file parameter, specifying the genotype information file required by the software. **phef** is the phenotype file parameter, specifying the phenotypic record information file required by the software. Both of these parameters are mandatory for the software to run, and can be specified using either relative or absolute paths.

The genotype file input format should follow the PLINK binary file format, consisting of three files with the extensions .fam, .bim, and .bed, respectively. For more details on the file formats, please refer to the [PLINK File Format Documentation](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats).

The phenotype file input format is a plain text file, using spaces or tabs as delimiters. Whether the file is in DOS or UNIX format is not critical, although it is recommended to use the UNIX format for more stable software operation. The file should not include a header. For more detailed information regarding the input file formats, please refer to the "File Formats" chapter.

## 4. File Description

The relevant files include the required pedigree files and genotype files. Files should be ASCII-formatted files, separated by one or multiple spaces (or newline characters). The variable names for categories can include English letters and numbers. The individual numbers should be consistent across different files.

### 4.2 Input Files

The input files include required phenotype files, genotype files, genomic partitioning files, and prior variance component files. The phenotype file should be in ASCII format, with data fields separated by one or more spaces (or newline characters). Category variable names can include alphanumeric characters, and individual IDs should be consistent across all files.

#### 4.2.1 Phenotype File

The phenotype file should be a plain text file format, primarily used to provide individual IDs and the phenotypic values of traits to be analyzed. It can also include the identifiers for fixed effects and random effect groupings. The individual IDs should be placed in the first column, followed by columns containing phenotypic values. If fixed effects and other non-genetic random effects need to be fitted into the model, additional columns should be included in the file. Here is an example of a phenotype file:

```text
10004 1 1 1.96
10011 1 2 1.39
10019 1 2 -99
10023 1 1 2.22
10030 1 2 2.91
...
```

The columns represent the following:

- **ID**: Individual identifier
- **mu**: Intercept term
- **Sex**: Gender
- **y**: Phenotypic value

Missing phenotypic values are represented as `-99` (can be adjusted using the appropriate parameter).

#### 4.2.2 Genotype File

The genotype file is used for sampling marker effects during the calculation and for quality control of markers and individuals. It is formatted in one of two common PLINK file types:

**Binary format files** (`*.fam`, `*.bim`, `*.bed`). 

You only need to specify the file prefix, which can be a relative (`./geno/prefix`) or absolute path (`/storage1/data/geno/prefix`).

**012-encoded raw file (*.raw)**

The *.raw file format can be generated by PLINK using the following command:

```bash
plink --bfile 1 ârecode A --out 1
```

The genotype file must contain breed markers in the column corresponding to family IDs, which indicate the breed affiliation of each individual.

#### 4.2.3 Marker Chromosome and Physical Location File

If you are using a `*.raw` genotype file in 012 format, and you want the software to divide SNPs into blocks based on the number of markers or linkage disequilibrium (LD) information, you need to provide an additional map file that specifies the chromosome and physical location for each marker. This map file follows the standard PLINK format, as shown below:

```text
1	M52  	0.03678	36780  
1	M129	0.10465	104650  
1	M294	0.23881	238810  
1	M330	0.26796	267960  
1	M374	0.3079	307900  
... 
```

For more details on the format, refer to the PLINK documentation:
https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats.

#### 4.2.4 Genomic Block Partitioning File

The model includes heterogeneous genetic covariance, requiring chromosome segmentation into blocks. When users provide a genomic partitioning file, it should contain the number of markers in each block. This file contains a single column, where each line indicates the number of markers in a block. Here's an example:

```text
148
98
87
80
109
...
```

Alternatively, the file can have a more detailed format, like the following:

```text
1 1 320342 9318788 154
2 1 9318788 13417613 86
3 1 13417613 17786299 89
4 1 17786299 23858687 78
5 1 23858687 29949287 114
...
```

In this case, additional columns are allowed, as long as you specify which column contains the number of markers per block (e.g., using `--bincol 5`). The columns represent block ID, chromosome, start position, stop position, and the number of SNPs per block. The software uses only the last column, so you must specify which column contains the marker count. The software assigns markers to specified blocks sequentially from the genotype file.

If users provide both a custom block file and set genotype quality control parameters, the number of markers after quality control must match the numbers in the partitioning file. Otherwise, the program will exit with an error.

The software folder (`src`) contains a script for dividing the genome into blocks based on LD information. You can use the following command to generate a block partitioning file for use with the mbBayesABLD model:

```bash
cd ./mbBayesABLD-main/example  
../src/lava_LD_block.sh --bfile genotype --type LD --out ld_blocks.txt  
```

The first 6 lines of the output file will look like this:

```text
LOC CHR START STOP nSNP  
1 1 320342 9318788 154
2 1 9318788 13417613 86
3 1 13417613 17786299 89
4 1 17786299 23858687 78
5 1 23858687 29949287 114
...
```

#### 4.2.5 Variance Component Prior File

The software allows users to provide prior information for the variance components, including the prior scale matrix for the variance-covariance matrix of marker effects in each block. Each line represents a variance-covariance matrix. For example, the prior variance-covariance matrix for Block 1 with two breeds is:
$$
\sigma(b_1, b_1) \ \ \sigma(b_1, b_2) \ \ \sigma(b_1, b_2) \ \ \sigma(b_2, b_2)
$$
For three blocks, the complete prior file would look like this:

```text
0.10 0.10 0.10 0.20  
0.23 0.23 0.23 0.33  
0.26 0.26 0.26 0.36  
0.30 0.30 0.30 0.40  
```

The first three lines provide the prior variance for each block, and the last line represents the prior residual variance.

### 4.3 Output Files

The output files mainly include the breeding value files, fixed effect estimates, variance component files, parameter iteration estimates, log files, and more.

#### 4.3.1 Breeding Values

The breeding values for each breed are output into separate files. For joint prediction of three breeds, you can specify the following parameter for the output files:

```bash
--gebvOut EBV
```

The prefix "EBV" will be used for the breeding value output files, and the resulting files will be named `EBV_y1.txt`, `EBV_y2.txt`, and `EBV_y3.txt`, containing the breeding values for each breed. Hereâs an example format for the file `EBV_y1.txt`:

```text
ID        EBV  
710387    2.406609E-01  
710392    4.330189E-01  
710396    3.861383E-01  
...
```

The file contains two columns with headers. The first column provides the individual IDs, and the second column contains the corresponding breeding values. All breeding value output files follow the same format.

#### 4.3.2 Posterior Means of Marker Effects

After the program completes successfully, it outputs the posterior means of the marker effects. The file format looks as follows:

```text
-1.509555E-05  -8.801209E-05  
-2.197057E-04   6.185192E-06  
2.724469E-04   -1.391984E-04  
...
```

The number of rows equals the number of quality-controlled markers, and the number of columns corresponds to the number of breeds.

#### 4.3.3 Fixed Effect Estimates (`sol.txt`)

If fixed effects (including intercept) were specified in the parameters, the posterior means of the fixed effects will be output to a designated file. Here is an example format of the fixed effect estimates file:

```
1.469106E+00   2.337024E+00  
-3.382830E+00  -3.398553E+00  
3.350822E+00   2.968550E+00  
3.702356E+00   -2.376497E+00  
-2.281983E+00  2.093072E-01  
```

This file contains three fixed effects: population mean, gender, and breed. The levels of each fixed effect are 1, 2, and 2, respectively, resulting in a total of 5 rows. Each row represents the estimated value for one level of a fixed effect across two âtraitsâ (which in practice are different breeds).

#### 4.3.4 Variance Component File

The format of the output posterior means of variance components follows the same structure as the input prior variance component file. For more details, refer to section 5.2.4.

#### 4.3.5 Parameter Iteration Estimates

If the user specifies the output of all iterations of selected parameters using the `--mcmcOut` option, the values for each iteration are written to the specified file. Each row represents the estimated values for unknown parameters during a single iteration, and the number of columns corresponds to the number of unknown parameters specified. The number of rows equals `(iter-burnin)/thin`.

#### 4.3.6 Log Files

If the user does not want the log information to be printed directly to the console during runtime, they can redirect the log information to a file by specifying a path for the log file. The format of the log file is as follows:
